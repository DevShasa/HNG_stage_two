                        Hello I am Shasa, A frontend and backend developer. I am excited
                        to take part in the HNG internship. I have limited professional experience
                        as a software devloper, however I have been furiously self learning and I believe
                        that I can make a crucial addition to any team. I am proficient in css, react, and django. I 
                        am excited to meet other talented developers, lets team up!

                                I have managed to tame the CSS gods and as a result, I can replicate
                                any design. I code all my layouts in plain css. I also include  
                                react here and there for extra razmatazz! My main css tools of trade are GRID
                                and FLEXBOX.

                            <h3>React</h3>

                                I have been learning react and I am conversant with several core 
                                react technologies like props, hooks, and context amongst others.
                                This internship will be my first major react project and I am exited to take
                                part in the challenge.

                                I have been coding backends with Django for roughly one year now. 
                                As such, I am comfortable with backends and able to tackle any challenge 
                                thrown my way, from eccomerce backends to performant API's.
